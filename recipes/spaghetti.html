        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe is based on Bolognese sauce, where the meat sauce simmers on the stove for hours and hours, getting all the flavors to marry together, get concentrated and incredible. This quick version of meatsauce is just as great because of a few things that make a big difference. <em>#1</em> Use lots of caramelized vegetables in the sauce. They really give the sauce so much deep flavor. Cooking them until they are soft, tender and golden is the trick. It will start that caramelization process, adding a natural sweetness and lots of flavor. <em>#2</em> Season the sauce liberally, during every stage of the cooking process, with both dry and fresh herbs.</p>
