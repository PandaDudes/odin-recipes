        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Making dumplings at home is incredibly easy; the hardest part about the whole process is pleating them (which is also easy!). These dumplings have a short list of ingredients, but are nevertheless incredibly flavorful, perfect for dunking in a range of different sauces.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound pork shoulder or pork belly, trimmed of connective tissue, but with fat intact, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 pound slab bacon, cut into 1/2-inch cubes, frozen</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chicken stock, pork stock, or cold water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine or dry sherry</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>16 scallions, white and green parts, finely sliced</li>
            <li>Round dumpling wrappers</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Toss cubes of pork and salt in a medium bowl. Spread the pork pieces on a rimmed baking sheet, leaving space between the pieces than place in the freezer for 15 minutes until just starting to freeze, but still pliable.</li>
            <li>In bowl of food processor, combine salted pork, bacon, egg, stock, soy sauce, and sugar. Process until a rough puree is formed and pieces of pork are no larger than 1/8th of an inch, about 20 seconds. Add leeks to food processor and pulse until evenly incorporated, about 6 one-second pulses.</li>
            <li>Working with a few skins at a time, place approximately 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of each wrapper. Use your finger to spread a small amount of water around the edge of each wrapper. Seal wrappers by folding in half and pleating one side 5 or 6 times, pinching the edges together as you go. Place finished dumplings on a parchment-lined baking sheet, separating them to avoid sticking, and covering the whole thing with a clean, damp washcloth.</li>
            <li>Line a bamboo steamer with wilted cabbage or lettuce leaves, or create a parchment liner. Place dumplings in steamer, leaving a small gap between each one a place over a wok of simmering water. Steam for 7 to 9 minutes until skins are translucent and filling is cooked through. Serve immediately with soy sauce, chili paste, Chinkiang vinegar, black vinegar, or plain rice vinegar.</li>
        </ol>
